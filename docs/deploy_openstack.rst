OpenStack Deployment
====================

.. note:: Althouth we would like to support different `OpenStack <https://www.openstack.org/>`__ environments, we
          tested :ref:`openstack_deploy` just for the `ISP RAS one <https://cloud.ispras.ru>`__.

Additional Software Requirements
--------------------------------

To install additional packages required only by OpenStack deployment scripts you need to execute the following command::

    $ pip install -r requirements-openstack.txt ".[openstack]"

.. note:: If in the previous step you installed Klever package with the `-e` argument, then you should use it here as
          well (i.e. execute `pip install -e ".[openstack]"`).

Supported Options
-----------------

:ref:`openstack_deploy` supports 2 kinds of entities:

* :ref:`klever_base_image` - with default settings this is a Debian 9 OpenStack image with installed Klever
  dependencies.
  Using :ref:`klever_base_image` allows to substantially reduce a time for deploying other :ref:`klever_inst`.
* :ref:`klever_inst` - an OpenStack instance, either for development or production purposes.
  For development mode many debug options are activated by default.

Almost all deployment commands require you to specify path to the private SSH key and your OpenStack username:

.. parsed-literal::

    $ klever-deploy-openstack --os-username :term:`$OS_USERNAME` --ssh-rsa-private-key-file :term:`$SSH_RSA_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE` create instance

For brevity they are omitted from the following examples.

Also, in addition to command-line arguments mentioned above and below, there are several optional command-line arguments
which you can find out by running:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ klever-deploy-openstack --help

.. _klever_base_image:

Klever Base Image
-----------------

For :ref:`klever_base_image` you can execute actions *show*, *create* and *remove*.
The common workflow for :ref:`klever_base_image` is :menuselection:`create --> remove`, e.g.:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ klever-deploy-openstack create image

Unless specified, name *Klever Base vN* (where N is 1 plus a maximum of 0 and vi) is used for new
:ref:`klever_base_image`.
Besides, deployment scripts overwrites file :file:`klever/deploys/conf/openstack-base-image.txt` with this name so that
new instances will be based on the new :ref:`klever_base_image`.
To force other users to switch to the new :ref:`klever_base_image` you need to commit changes of this file to the
repository.

.. _klever_inst:

Klever Instance
---------------

For :ref:`klever_inst` you can execute actions *show*, *create*, *update*, *ssh*, *remove*, *share* and *hide*.
Basically you should perform actions with :ref:`klever_inst` in the following order:
:menuselection:`create --> update --> update --> ... --> update --> remove` exactly as for :ref:`local_deploy`, e.g.:

.. parsed-literal::

    $ klever-deploy-openstack create instance

By default Klever is deployed in production mode, but you can change this with the *--mode* command-line argument:

.. parsed-literal::

    $ klever-deploy-openstack --mode development create instance

In addition, between creating and removing you can also *share*/*hide* for/from the outside world :ref:`klever_inst`
and open an SSH connection to it.
By default name for :ref:`klever_inst` is a concatenation of :term:`$OS_USERNAME`, "klever", and the mode used
(development or production), e.g. *petrov-klever-development*.

.. _klever_insts:

Multiple Klever Instances
-------------------------

You can also create a specified number of OpenStack instances for performing various experiments by using the
*--instances* command-line argument.
In this mode you can only execute actions *show*, *create*, *update* and *remove*.
The normal workflow for :ref:`klever_insts` is the same as for :ref:`klever_inst`, e.g.:

.. parsed-literal::

    $ klever-deploy-openstack --instances :term:`$INSTANCES` create instance
